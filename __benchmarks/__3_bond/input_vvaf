#In this file we will be interested by the
#speed of elongation of a bond (d r / d t)
#This velocity will be multiplied by a coefficient (d v / d r)
#in order to calculate a time derivative value. For example:
#d mu / d t = (d mu / d r) (d r / d t)
#d alpha / d t = (d alpha / d r) (d r / d t)
#It becomes possible to calculate the second order susceptibility tensor

#The output contains 4 columns:
#1) Frequency
#2) Bond auto correlation: f(t) = < a(t) . m(0) >
#3) Intra-molecular correlation. Instead of using the dipole moment
#   / polarizability of the bonds we use those of their sum
#   m' = m_bond1 + m_bond_2
#   a' = a_bond1 + a_bond_2
#   g(t) = < a'(t) . m'(0) >
#4) Cross-correlation function. We sum all the contributions.
#   m'' = sum_i m_bondi
#   a'' = sum_i a_bondi
#   g(t) = < a''(t) . m''(0) >

#=================
# IMPORTANT REMARK
#=================
#Because of the ratio signal / noise, it may be usefull to restrict
#the cross-terms to the first or second solvation shell
#Please, refer to the benchmar number 6

#Because none of the water molecules of the toy model
#give an XXZ signal, I will focus exclusively on the IR
#and Raman spectra
#However, in a real system, you can play with the blocks
