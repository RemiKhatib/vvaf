#We generalize the concept used in 3
#d v / d t = (d v / d q) (d q / d t)
#where q is associated with a collective motion (a normal mode)

#I did the work only for a C2V symmetry (those of water)
#Therefore you have only 3 normal modes (Bending,
#Sym, Stretch, Antisym. Stretch)
#I use the molecular framework (x, y, z) as it is
#define usually for the C2V symmetry
#z along the bisector
#x in the molecular plane
#y out of the molecular plane

#The output contains 10 columns:
#  -One is associated with the frequency
#  -The others are associated with the decomposition into the normal
#   modes: f(t) = sum_Q1,Q2 ( < y_Q2(t) . x_Q1(0) > )
#   Since there are 3 modes for am AX2 molecule with a C2V symmetry,
#   You have 3x3 combinations
#Refer to the header to correctly attribute the different terms
